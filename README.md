With your desired Google Spreadsheet opened, go to Tools -> Script editor.

It should open an editor in a new page with a Code.gs file containing an empty function.
Remove any contents from Code.gs and save the project at File -> Save. Give any name you want.

Go back to code editor, select the Code.gs file in the directory and copy/paste the contents from Code.gs of this repo.



Do the same for appsscript.json and optionally set your desired timezone.

Save the project again and refresh/reload your Google Spreadsheet (hit F5 on the browser).

Once reloaded, you should see a navigation item "Zapdroid"

Go to Zapdroid at your spreadsheet's main menu and click on the Authorize add-on! item.

The popup will close and nothing will change on your spreadsheet yet!

Once the add-on is authorized, repeat step 5 (click Authorize add-on! again) and voila!
